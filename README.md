# Quantum Espresso workflow tool: `qeflow`

QE-flow is a python tool which helps to automate quantum espresso workflows "without scassamento di maroni", i.e. *easily*.
Out in the internet there are many other options that perform this very same tasks and in a much more efficient way.
The most notable are [pwtk](http://pwtk.ijs.si/index.html) and [aiida](https://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
However, in my opinion, these tools have a very steap learning curve. So I decided to just write my own.
